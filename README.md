Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. 
    The DriverPass project was a website meant for a driver's course tutoring service meant to help students prepare for their driving test.

Who was the client? 
    The client was the owner of DriverPass.  They've been building a successful business offline and wanted to build and online presence to help students learn and expand their business using virtual education.

What type of system did they want you to design?
    They wanted to building a leearning management system where students could study, take practice tests, schedule in-person tests, and then eventually take their road test.

What did you do particularly well?
    I felt that I did a great job of interpreting the needs of the client without over engineering the solution.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I would likely add more depth to my UML diagrams.  After seeing some of the work others had done, I think mine could've benefitted from more complexity and reach.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 
    I read through the interviews and thought about what else would be needed to make these things possible in a practical scenario.  I think it's easy to make promises to clients but it's hard to givet them honest feedback on what it would take to implement these things but it's important to bring these things together.

Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The user's needs are the whole point of developing a project.  We aren't there to satisfy our own hubris, we're meant to deliver upon someone's requests and give them what they asked for rather than what we would've wanted in the same circumstances.

How do you approach designing software? 
    I try to give them the most efficient solution at the lowest cost with the easiest maintenance.

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    In the future, I might use mid-cycle progress meetings and recaps to ensure that we were on track to deliver on the client's needs.
